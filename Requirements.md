# **Web Development Project Requirements**

## **Requirements**

### **1. Structural Design (HTML):**
- Include a well-structured HTML document with the following elements:
  - A `<header>` containing the website logo or project title.
  - A `<nav>` for navigation between sections/pages.
  - A `<main>` element for the main content of the page.
  - A `<footer>` element with relevant information (e.g., copyright or contact details).
- Utilize semantic HTML tags such as `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>` where appropriate.
- Include a form with the following fields:
  - A text input (e.g., name or email).
  - A dropdown menu or radio buttons for selection.
  - A submit button.

### **2. Styling and Layout (CSS):**
- Use **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** to arrange and align content.
- Define custom styles with **CSS Variables** for colors and fonts.
- Add **hover effects** to buttons and menus for interactivity.
- Incorporate at least one image as a background or design element using **background properties**.
- Ensure the website is **responsive**, adapting well to both desktop and mobile devices.

### **3. Interactivity (JavaScript):**
- Implement functionality that triggers an action when a button is clicked (e.g., display a message or change content).
- Add **form validation** to check user input before submission.
- Create a **popup (modal)** that shows a custom message.
- Develop a **toggle menu** that shows/hides when clicked.
- Use **DOM Manipulation** to dynamically update or add content to the page.

### **4. Documentation and Organization:**
- Add **comments** in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to explain key sections.
- Organize project files in a clear folder structure (e.g., separate folders for images, styles, and scripts).
- Use clear and descriptive identifiers for files, classes, and elements.

### **5. Optional Add-Ons (Bonus Points):**
- Implement **animations** using CSS or JavaScript.
- Add a **dark mode** feature to switch the website theme.
